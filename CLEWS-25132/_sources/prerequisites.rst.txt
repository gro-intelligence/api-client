The Gro API Client requires the following OS-dependent system requirements.

MacOS and Linux
===============

1. git `Installation instructions <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_
2. python version 3.5 or above from `<https://www.python.org>`_. Support for Python 2.7.13 or above is also maintained, but with its `End of Life <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html>`_ soon approaching, Python 3 is recommended.

Windows
=======

The Gro API Client package is supported both with or without Anaconda. However, some popular data science packages, including some used in the sample scripts provided, are only available on Windows via `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_. For that reason, instructions are provided for both. You should select the distribution that fits your requirements.

Anaconda
--------

1. Download Anaconda with Python 3.5 or above from `anaconda.com <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html>`_ soon approaching, it is recommended you start with Python 3.
2. Install Git from `git-scm.com <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_. Proceed with the default options.

Non-Anaconda
------------

#. Powershell (should come default with Windows)
#. Download Python version 3.5 or above from `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_. Support for Python 2.7.13 or above is also maintained, but with `its End of Life <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html>`_ soon approaching, it is recommended you start with Python 3.
#. Install both Python and pip to PATH either in the installer (enable component during the installation) or manually. The easiest way to do this is to make sure the below is checked during installation:
