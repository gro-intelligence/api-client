# Gro API Client

<https://www.gro-intelligence.com/products/gro-api>

Client library for accessing Gro Intelligence's agricultural data platform.

## Prerequisites

1. [MacOS and Linux](unix-setup.md)
2. [Windows](windows-setup.md)

## Install Gro API client packages

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client.git
```

Note that even if you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), the API Client install should still be performed using pip and not [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

## Gro API authentication token

Use the Gro web application to retrieve an authentication token (instructions are in the wiki [here](https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client/wiki/Authentication-Tokens#11-using-the-gro-web-application-preferred)).

### Saving your token as an environment variable (optional)

If you don't want to enter a password or token each time, you can save the token as an environment variable. Please consult your OS or IDE documentation for information on how to set environment variables, e.g. [setting environment variables in Windows Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-6) or [Mac OS X/Linux](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x) or [Anaconda environmnent variables](https://anaconda-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/work-with-variables.html). In some of the sample code, it is assumed that you have the token saved to your environment variables as `GROAPI_TOKEN`.

## Examples

Navigate to [api/client/samples/](api/client/samples/) folder and try executing the provided examples.

1. Start with [quick_start.py](api/client/samples/quick_start.py). This script creates an authenticated `GroClient` object and uses the `get_data_series()` and `get_data_points()` methods to find Area Harvested series for Ukrainian Wheat from a variety of different sources and output the time series points to a CSV file. You will likely want to revisit this script as a starting point for building your own scripts.

Note that the script assumes you have your authentication token set to a `GROAPI_TOKEN` environment variable (see [Saving your token as an environment variable](#saving-your-token-as-an-environment-variable-optional)). If you don't wish to use environment variables, you can modify the sample script to set [`ACCESS_TOKEN`](https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client/blob/0d1aa2bccaa25a033e39712c62363fd89e69eea1/api/client/samples/quick_start.py#L7) in some other way.

```sh
python quick_start.py
```

If the API client is installed and your authentication token is set, a csv file called `gro_client_output.csv` should be created in the directory where the script was run.

2. Try out [soybeans.py](api/client/samples/crop_models/soybeans.py) to see the `CropModel` class and its `compute_crop_weighted_series()` method in action. In this example, NDVI ([Normalized difference vegetation index](https://app.gro-intelligence.com/dictionary/items/321)) for provinces in Brazil is weighted against each province's historical soybean production to put the latest NDVI values into context. This information is put into a pandas dataframe, the description of which is printed to the console.

```sh
python crop_models/soybeans.py
```

3. See [brazil_soybeans.ipynb](https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client/blob/development/api/client/samples/crop_models/brazil_soybeans.ipynb) for a longer, more detailed demonstration of many of the API's capabilities in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

4. You can also use the included `gro_client` tool as a quick way to request a single data series right on the command line. Try the following:

```sh
gro_client --metric="Production Quantity mass" --item="Corn" --region="United States" --user_email="email@example.com"
```

The `gro_client` command line interface does a keyword search for the inputs and finds a random matching data series. It displays the data series it picked in the command line and writes the data points out to a file in the current directory called `gro_client_output.csv`. This tool is useful for simple queries, but anything more complex should be done using the provided Python packages.
