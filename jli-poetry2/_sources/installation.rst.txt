Install with pip

To find the location on your filesystem where the Gro package has been installed and to see the version you have installed you can use the query:

::

  pip show groclient



Stay updated
============

To ensure that you have the latest client version with newest features, you can use the following command:

::

  pip install --upgrade groclient
