Brazil Soybeans

See the `Brazil Soybeans <https://github.com/gro-intelligence/api-client/blob/development/api/client/samples/crop_models>`_ example in the crop models folder for a longer, more detailed demonstration of many of the API's capabilities in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

This notebook demonstrates the `CropModel` class and its :code:`compute_crop_weighted_series()` method in action. In this example, NDVI (`normalized difference vegetation index <https://app.gro-intelligence.com/dictionary/items/321>`_) for provinces in Brazil is weighted against each province's historical soybean production to put the latest NDVI values into context.
