TODO(jli): The example above nicely links to the latest *released* version,
rather than development. That's probably the way to go, since almost all users
should be using our PyPI package. However, the 'latest_version' variable seems
to be hardcoded to "master". Would be great if it actually used the latest
released tag instead.
