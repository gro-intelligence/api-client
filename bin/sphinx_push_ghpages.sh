# sphinx-multiversion. It should be run from the base of the git repo.
# It's largely based on sphinxcontrib-versioning's code:
# https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinxcontrib-versioning/blob/920edec0ac764081b583a2ecf4e6952762b9dbf2/sphinxcontrib/versioning/__main__.py#L332

ROOT_REF=development
# Files to keep in the repo. Analogous to scv_grm_exclude:

## prepare helper repo

# clone into temp dir
echo -e "\n-> cloning $REPO to temp dir $TMPDIR..."
cd "$TMPDIR"
git clone "$REPO" --quiet --depth=1 --branch="${PAGES_BRANCH}" .
# remove old files
git rm -rf --quiet .
# restore some files we want to keep. note: using bash array syntax.
git reset --quiet HEAD -- "${KEEP_FILES[@]}"
git checkout -- "${KEEP_FILES[@]}"


## build docs

echo -e "\n-> building docs..."
# 'sphinx-multiversion ../docs .' fails, so we just cd back out for this step.
cd ..
sphinx-multiversion docs "$TMPDIR"
cd "$TMPDIR"

# With sphinxcontrib-versioning, we would generate a separate directory of docs
# for each version tag and branch, but also have the 'development' branch's
# docs at the top level.  sphinx-multiversion only generates the separate
# directories. To avoid breaking links, we copy the the root ref docs (i.e.,
# the development branch docs) to the parent directory containing all docs.
echo -e "\n-> copying root ref ($ROOT_REF) to docs root..."
cp -R "${ROOT_REF}/." .

echo -e "\n-> checking for changes..."
git add .
# ignore trivial changes (.doctrees and .buildinfo files are always modified
# when rebuilding the docs). Notes:
# - '|| true' is needed because when grep fails to match something, it returns
#   a non-zero exit code, which causes the script to fail due to the 'pipefail'
#   setting.
# - this logic differs from sphinxcontrib-versioning slightly. SCV ignores
#   searchindex.js but not .buildinfo. I didn't notice searchindex.js being
#   regenerated unnecessarily, but did see that happening with .buildinfo files.
CHANGED=$(git diff HEAD --no-ext-diff --name-status | grep -v '^M.*\.doctrees/' | grep -v '^M.*\.buildinfo$' || true)
