# When packaging a version-tagged commit, the version is just the tag name
# (e.g. "1.84.0"). When the commit isn't version-tagged, we include a ".devN"
# suffix denoting how far from the last tagged version the commit is.
#
# Note that the .devN suffixes are ambiguous (with different branches, there
# can be different commits that result in the same .devN suffix). We use this
# scheme because PyPI requires it. We avoid ambiguity by:
# - PyPI: only uploading release packages
# - TestPyPI: only uploading packages when commits are merged to development
