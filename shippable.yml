# This disables Shippable for gh-pages.
# 
# It's not sufficient to specify this in the main branch's shippable.yml since
# Shippable only looks at each branch's shippable.yml file:
# http://docs.shippable.com/ci/specify-branches/
#
# We use a wildcard instead of 'gh-pages' because branches of gh-pages also
# shouldn't have Shippable be triggered. (This should be rare, as changes to
# gh-pages should be automated, but it occasionally happens.)
# 
# Using the wildcard here doesn't disable shippable for other branches, since
# Shippable uses each branch's own shippable.yml
